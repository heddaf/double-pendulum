# The Double Pendulum

This is a simple script animating the double pendulum. It's using
the Euler's method which is simple and straight forward.


## Preparations


### Python

You wil need to have python3 installed on your machine.
You can check this from the command line (terminal) by typing:

    which python3

or

    python3 -V

Once that is out of the way you will need to install a couple of Python packages that
is referenced in the lab script. That is done using the `pip` program:

#### matplotlib

We are using the matplotlib.animation package to make the animation:

    pip install matplotlib

#### numpy:

Install the numpy math package:

    pip install numpy


## Running

Open a terminal and navigate to your source code. Run the program:

    python3 double_pendulum_animation.py

The above command should show you a double pendulum in motion.
